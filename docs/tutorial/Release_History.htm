<p>AribaWeb has been a commercially deployed component of Ariba, Inc's network services
(e.g. <a href="http://supplier.ariba.com"


>Ariba Supplier Network</a>,
<a href="http://discovery.ariba.com"


>Ariba Discovery</a>)
and On Demand <a href="http://www.ariba.com/solutions/"


>Spend Management application suite</a> since
late 1999.  The framework evolved steadily in dozens of releases over that time,
and was first released as Open Source in May 2008.</p>

<p>Below is a brief history of the major releases of the framework:</p>

</ul>
